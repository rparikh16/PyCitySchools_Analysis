# PyCitySchools_Challenge

The purpose of this analysis was to clean up the raw data given to us for students in 15 high schools and determine findings based on the results. The first part of the code is to clean up the data as 1,968 reading scores and 982 math scores were inputted as NaN, and 1,836 rows had duplicate values, and finally the grades inputted had to changed to integers to allow for calulcations. A high-level look was taken at the data to fine the over all count, mean, st. deviation, min and max of the numbered data for all grades, only grade 9 and only grade 10. The lowest reading score was determined to be at Dixon High School, thus a further analysis into Dixon High Schools reading scores were done and was determined to have an avg score of 75%. The average school budger was determined for charter and public schools and results showed public shcools with a higher budget. The number of students currently enrolled in each high school was also determined with Montgomery High School with the largest size. Further analysis could show the average scores for each highschool and each grade to determine which high school is permforming best and which grades are receiving the most attention.
